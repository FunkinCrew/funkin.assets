Hit sounds must have "Hit" at the end of their name (ex: slapHit)

Hold sounds are optional and they should have "Hold" at the end of their name (ex: slapHold)
(hold sounds may or may not be implemented as of writing this)

In order to add new sounds, the sounds must be implemented through code.
Search through the source code for the sound names minus the "Hit" part (ex: "pingPong", "vineBoom") and you'll find basically everything.
