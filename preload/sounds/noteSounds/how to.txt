# Hit sound creation 101

1. Create a new folder for your hit sound, use the camelCase convention

2. Add your sounds into the folder using the following naming conventions:
- "begin" (played once when the player first clicks a note)
- "beginSustain" (same as "begin" but specific to sustain notes, will use "begin" by default if this doesn't exist)
- "sustain" (a looping sound played while a sustain note is being held down. avoid overall rythmical sounds as they can sound off-beat or get cut off, try something like white noise)
- "end" (played when the note is let go)
- "endSustain" (played when the player reaches the end of the sustain note, won't play if the player lets go mid-note)
- "miss" (played once when a note passed by and the player is no longer able to press the note)
- "missSustain" (same as "miss", but it also plays if the player lets go of the sustain note too early)
NOTE: As of writing this, only "begin" and "beginSustain" are currently implemented.

3. Register the new sound by adding it to the NoteSoundType enum, located at "funkin.play.notes.notesound.NoteSoundType" (the sound ID must match the folder name)

4. Add the sound to the preferences menu and assign a display name to it in funkin.ui.options.PreferencesMenu

Done!
